<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>The New Zealand government has set a target of increasing the number of EVs in New Zealand to 64,000 by 2021. High penetration of EVs would cause EV recharging to contribute a substantial portion of total electricity load. A report prepared for lines companies Orion, Powerco and Unison by Concept Consulting Group entitled “Driving change - Issues and options to maximise the opportunities from large-scale electric vehicle uptake in New Zealand” predicts that if all current light private vehicles were electric, annual residential electricity consumption would increase by approximately 30%, whereas if all vehicles including trucks were electric, this would increase the total electricity consumption of New Zealand by approximately 41%<span class="citation">[@ConceptConsulting2018]</span>.</p>
<p>New Zealand’s total electricity demand varies throughout the day, with weekdays in particular having two distinct “peaks”; one in the morning, and one in the evening. Providing the electricity to meet these demand peaks is a costly and inefficient process. Concurrent electric vehicle (EV) charging, especially in the early evening when many motorists return home, would have the potential to negatively impact the operation of the grid through drastically increasing peak loads <span class="citation">[@Azadfar2015]</span>, leading to an increased cost of electricity due to the requirement of expensive upgrades to the electricity grid<span class="citation">[@stephenson_smart_2017]</span>.</p>
<p>The Concept Consulting report considers different methods of EV charging in its models. The assumption that most drivers would begin charging immediately after returning home is referred to as “passive” charging, while charging that is programmed (either by the driver or by an external entity) to occur during off-peak periods is referred to as “smart”. The key findings of the Concept Consulting report are as follows.</p>
<p>Under a scenario whereby 57% of the current private vehicle fleet were EVs (corresponding to one EV per household): * If all were charged in a passive fashion, New Zealand’s peak electricity demand would increase by appproximately 3,000MW * If all were charged in a “smart” fashion, there would be no increase in peak demand</p>
<p>This report extends the work done by Concept Consulting, but utilises actual data collected from electric vehicles, as opposed to using models based on current usage patterns of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. The intention of the report is to provide further insight into the potential effects on the New Zealand electricity grid that may occur with a dramatic increase in EVs, so that these may be planned for and mitigated. It is also inspired by the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/764270/electric-chargepoint-analysis-2017-domestics.pdf">UK DoT statistical report 2018</a>.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Data information</h1>
<div id="background" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Background</h2>
<p>The data used has been provided by “Flip the Fleet”, a community organisation that hopes to increase uptake of electric vehicles in New Zealand. Flip the Fleet have been collecting data on electric vehicle usage patterns, collected using Exact IOT Limited’s <a href="https://flipthefleet.org/ev-black-box/">blackbox recorder</a>, a small electronic device that connects to the vehicle’s internal computer and sends detailed data about the battery health, consumption, speed, etc.</p>
<p>The data used consisted of 1291881 data points from 44 vehicles over 8 months (April 2018 - January 2019). The recorder provided measurements at 1 minute frequency of charging power and battery charge state.</p>
<p>Due to privacy considerations, the data is not publicly available.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-cleaning" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Initial cleaning</h2>
<p>There were 6 additional vehicles in the data provided that had no recorded charging occur. These were immediately discarded.</p>
<p>Some instances of charging power greater than 120kW were recorded. These were considered anomalies and discarded, as these exceed the capacity of the highest charging stations available in New Zealand<span class="citation">[@ConceptConsulting2018]</span>.</p>
<p>Instances of battery state of charge being greater than 100% or less than 0% were also discarded.</p>
</div>
<div id="cleaning" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Definitions and preparation</h2>
<p>Charging data has been broadly separated into two separate categories, “standard” and “fast”. Standard charging is when the charger is reading less than 7kW - this is considered the upper limit of what can be obtained from a standard home charging scenario without an expensive wiring upgrade<span class="citation">[@ConceptConsulting2018]</span>. Fast charging is all charging above 7kW, and would likely occur at designated and purpose-built fast charging stations.</p>
<p>The data was also categorised according to whether it was a weekday or not. This allows analysis to occur of differing charging patterns between weekdays and weekends, allowing for further accuracy in determining the effects of electric vehicles on grid peaks.</p>
<p>In order to determine charging durations, rows were initially flagged as “charging begins” if the charging power was greater than zero and the previous and following row’s charging power were (respectively) equal to zero and greater than zero. Similarly, rows were flagged as “charge ends” if the charging power was greater than zero and the previous and following row’s charging power were (respectively) greater than zero and equal to zero.</p>
<p>Using this method we obtained 7376 instances of charge beginning, and 7385 instances of charge ending. The additional 9 instances of the charge ending than there are of the charge beginning may be due to the first instance of data collection occurring during mid-charge for some vehicles.</p>
<p>The charge duration was then calculated as being the time duration between each pair of “charge begins” and “charge ends” flags.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:durationHist">2.1</a> shows the overall distribution of all charging sequences. Clearly there are very small and a few very large values for Standard Charges, but this is not the case for Fast charges.</p>

<p>Manual inspection of the data showed that these short-duration charging “events” generally occurred near the end of a longer-duration charging event. It appeared that once the vehicle had reached its highest state of charge, charging would intermittently stop and start again. This is likely due to the behaviour of the charger once the battery was almost full. As these can not be considered truly independent charging events, they have been removed from the data for the analyses in Sections <a href="#keyFindings">3</a> and <a href="#duration">6</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the myriad “small” charging duration values, a small amount of unreasonably long charging durations (longer than 100 hours for standard charging or longer than 14 hours for fast charging) were calculated. As these exceeded the expected charge durations of the most high capacity vehicles currently available, they were assumed to be anomalies and are not included in the analyses in Sections <a href="#keyFindings">3</a> and <a href="#duration">6</a>.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:longDuration">2.3</a> shows the distribution of charging sequences with the excessively long or short events removed. As we can see these appear to be generally less than 3 hours in length for Standard Charges.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Power supplied</em>: The median power supplied during a standard charging was 1.78 kW. The mean was slightly higher at 2.12 kW. Fast charging observations had a median of 30.84 kW (mean = 30.68);</li>
<li><em>Charging duration</em>: Charging durations tended to fall into one of two groups. Longer ‘standard’ charges had a median duration of 3.48 hours and a mean duration of 4.07 hour. High power “fast” charge events had a median duration of 12.47 minutes and a mean duration of 13.87 minutes.</li>
<li><em>Time of Day</em>: Standard charging events tended to begin around 10pm, suggesting drivers set timers to take advantage of off-peak electricity. Fast charging events tended to begin at 11:30am on weekdays and 1pm during weekends.</li>

<p>Figure <a href="#fig:obsPower">4.1</a> shows the distribution of observed charging kW demand by inferred charge type. This plot shows that fast charges are relatively rare in the dataset whilst standard charges are much more common, and are concentrated around 1.8kW, 3kW and 6kW.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="#fig:dailyPower">5.1</a> shows the distribution of observed charging kW demand by day of the week.

<div id="duration" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Charging duration</h1>
<p>Figures <a href="#fig:durationTimeBox">6.1</a> and <a href="#fig:durationTimeMean">6.2</a> show that the duration of standard charging events by event start time drops significantly for events beginning around 9:45am. This may indicate that people are plugging in after returning home from a school run or other morning activity, even though the battery is still close to full capacity. It may also suggest that those who plug in shortly after 9:45am but do not have a high battery state of charge are only “topping up”, and take the vehicle out again before charging is fully complete. Duration of fast charge events by event start time appear to be more randomly distributed, although very few events were recorded between midnight and 7am. This, along with the comparatively low number of recorded fast charge events indicated in Fig. <a href="#fig:obsPower">4.1</a> suggests that drivers utilize fast charging only “as necessary” to ensure they have enough battery capacity to complete their journey.</p>

<pre><code>## Saving 7 x 5 in image</code></pre>
<p>As can be seen in Figure <a href="#fig:SoCplot1">7.1</a>, using the originally defined “charge begins” data we have the majority of charges beginning while the state of charge is above 90%. This is likely due to the manner in which the charger regularly turns off and on again near the end of the charging cycle as described in Section @ref<cleaning>.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:SoCplot2">7.2</a> shows the state of charge values when charge begins but with state of charge greater than 90% removed from the data. The figure shows that many vehicles arrive home with greater than 50% charge remaining. This indicates that charging may be delayed until early the following morning (during low aggregate electricity demand) while providing enough “back up” state of charge to allow for small evening trips if necessary. Alternatively, the battery may be able to transfer energy to the home during the evening grid peak as a form of demand response.</p>

<p>Standard charging has a noticeably different profile to charging patterns for fast charges. It suggests that it is common for plug-in vehicle owners to charge overnight at home, and perhaps use the more powerful public chargepoints to top up during the day.</p>
<p>Standard charging events most commonly began around 10pm during both weekdays and weekends. As it seems unlikely that this is due to vehicle drivers returning home at this hour, this effect may be due to drivers setting the charger on a timer to take advantage of cheaper “off-peak” electricity times, which frequently begin around 10pm.</p>
<p>Fast charging events tended to begin at 11:30am on weekdays and 1pm during weekends.</p>
