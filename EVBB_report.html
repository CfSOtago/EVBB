<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>The New Zealand government has set a target of increasing the number of EVs in New Zealand to 64,000 by 2021. High penetration of EVs would cause EV recharging to contribute a substantial portion of total electricity load. A report prepared for lines companies Orion, Powerco and Unison by Concept Consulting Group entitled “Driving change - Issues and options to maximise the opportunities from large-scale electric vehicle uptake in New Zealand” predicts that if all current light private vehicles were electric, annual residential electricity consumption would increase by approximately 30%, whereas if all vehicles including trucks were electric, this would increase the total electricity consumption of New Zealand by approximately 41%[concept_2018].</p>
<p>New Zealand’s total electricity demand varies throughout the day, with weekdays in particular having two distinct “peaks”; one in the morning, and one in the evening. Providing the electicity to meet these demand peaks is a costly and inefficient process. Concurrent electric vehicle (EV) charging, especially in the early evening when many motorists return home, would have the potential to negatively impact the operation of the grid through drastically increasing peak loads [Azadfar2015], leading to an increased cost of electricity due to the requirement of expensive upgrades to the electricity grid<span class="citation">[@stephenson_smart_2017]</span>.</p>
<p>This report hopes to provide further insight into the potential effects on the New Zealand electricity grid that may occur with a dramatic increase in EVs, so that these may be planned for and mitigated. It is based on and inspired by the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/764270/electric-chargepoint-analysis-2017-domestics.pdf">UK DoT statistical report 2018</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Data information</h1>
<p>The data used has been provided by “Flip the Fleet”, a community organisation that hopes to increase uptake of electric vehicles in New Zealand. Flip the Fleet have been collecting data on electric vehicle usage patterns, collected using Exact IOT Limited’s <a href="https://flipthefleet.org/ev-black-box/">blackbox recorder</a>, a small electronic device that connects to the vehicle’s internal computer and sends detailed data about the battery health, consumption, speed, etc.</p>
<p>The data used consisted of 1291881 data points from 44 vehicles over 8 months (April 2018 - January 2019). The recorder provided measurements at 1 minute frequency of charging behaviour and battery charge state.</p>
<p>Due to privacy considerations, the data is not publically available.</p>
<div id="initial-cleaning" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Initial cleaning</h2>
<p>There were 6 vehicles that had no recorded charging occur. These were immediately discarded from the data.</p>
<p>Some instances of charging power greater than 120kW were recorded. These were considered anomolies and discarded, as these exceed the capacity of the highest charging stations available in New Zealand<span class="citation">[@concept2018]</span>.</p>
<p>Instances of battery state of charge being greater than 100% or less than 0% were also discarded.</p>
</div>
<div id="definitions-and-preparation" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Definitions and preparation</h2>
<p>Charging data has been broadly seperated into two seperate catagories, “standard” and “fast”. Standard charging is when the charger is reading less than 7kW - this is considered the upper limit of what can be obtained from a standard home charging scenario without an expensive wiring upgrade<span class="citation">[@concept2018]</span>. Fast charging is all charging above 7kW, and would likely occur at designated and purpose-built fast charging stations.</p>
<p>The data was also catagorised according to whether it was a weekday or not. This allows analysis to occur of differing charging patterns between weekdays and weekends, allowing for further accuracy in determining the effects of electric vehicles on grid peaks.</p>
<p>In order to determine charging durations, rows were initially flagged as “charging begins” if the charging power was greater than zero and the previous and following row’s charging power were (respectively) equal to zero and greater than zero. Similarly, rows were flagged as “charge ends” if the charging power was greater than zero and the previous and following row’s charging power were (respectively) greater than zero and equal to zero.</p>
<p>Using this method we obtained 7376 instances of charge beginning, and 7385 instances of charge ending. The additional 9 instances of the charge ending than there are of the charge beginning may be due to the first instance of data collection occurring during mid-charge for some vehicles.</p>
<p>If we assume that the first non-zero charge observation is the ‘start’ and the last non-zero charge observation within the vehicle id is the ‘end’ we can calculate the duration between the two. This assumes there is no missing data.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:durationHist">2.1</a> shows the overall distribution of all charging sequences. Clearly there are very small and a few very large values for Standard Charges, but this is not the case for Fast charges.</p>

<p>Manual inspection of the data showed that these short-duration charging “events” generally occurred near the end of a longer-duration charging event. It appeared that once the vehicle had reached its highest state of charge, charging would intermittantly stop and start again, often at low power (&lt; 1kW). This is likely due to the behaviour of the charger once the battery was almost full. As these can not be considered truly independent charging events, they have been removed from the data for the rest of the analysis.</p>
<p>In addition to the myriad “small” charging duration values, two very large charging durations (longer than 100 hours) were calculated. As even a very high capacity vehicle using the slowest standard charger would not take this long to charge from empty, these were assumed to be anomalies and were discarded.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:longDuration">2.3</a> shows the distribution of charging sequences with the excessively long or short events removed. As we can see these appear to be generally less than 3 hours in length for Standard Charges.</p>
<p>All further duration-related analysis is conducted with these excessively long or short events removed from the data.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Power supplied</em>: The median power supplied during a standard charging was 1.78 kW. The mean was slightly lower at 2.12 kW. Fast charging observations had a higher median of 30.84 kW (mean = 30.68);</li>
<li><em>Charging duration</em>: Charging durations tended to fall into one of two groups - longer ‘overnight’ charges with a median of XX hours and shorter events during the day both at standard and fast charge rates with a median duration of XX hours.</li>
<li><em>Time of Day</em>: charging events were more frequent at specific times of the day and day of the week with more evening and over-night charging during weekdays and more day-time charging at weekends. The power demand also varied according to time of day and day of the week.</li>

<p>Figure <a href="#fig:obsPower">4.1</a> shows the distribution of observed charging kW demand by inferred charge type. This plot shows that fast charges are relatively rare in the dataset whilst standard charges are much more common and, partly due to our definition, are concentrated around 3 kW. At the present time charging at home is likely to be predominatly standard charging whilst charging outside the home is likely to be a mix of the two.</p>

<p>At home charging events tended to begin at HH:MM during weekdays and HH:MM at weekends. <em>We can get “Slow” charging events rather than “home”</em></p>
<p>Standard charging has a noticeably different profile to charging patterns for fast charges. It suggests that it is common for plug-in vehicle owners to charge overnight at home, and perhaps use the more powerful public chargepoints to top up during the day.</p>

<p>The duration of charging events (see Section <a href="#duration">6</a>) suggests that EVs may be ‘plugged in’ at home (and elsewhere) for considerable durations.</p>

<p>The figure shows that many vehicles arrive home with greater than 50% charge remaining and would therefore be able to transfer energy to the home during the evening grid peak as a form of demand response.</p>
