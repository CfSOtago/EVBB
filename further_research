To accurately analyse time-averaged data:

Many opportunities for further research involve using mean values over time. What we currently have is mean values of the instances during which data was being collected, but it appears most of the times that the vehicles were not either driving or charging, no data was collected. This makes the time-averaged plots both messy and practically useless. As an example, in the plots of daily charging demand (deleted from main report) no weighting is given to the fact that charging is occurring more frequently at certain times than others. 

The data is quite sporadic (data from different vehicles have different start dates and times, and data not sent at consistent time intervals). As far as I understand, in order to get true mean values over time we need to consider the zero values where no charging or driving was occurring. For this, I presume we need to create an "empty" dataframe for each individual vehicle that consists of a datetime column, and then columns of zeros for each variable we want to find the mean of, running the duration of each vehicle's data collection period at predetermined intervals (15 mins should be sufficient). To this we would "add" the original data that falls within each within each time interval, allowing true mean values to be found from the new dataframe. This would assume no missing non-zero data during the dates between which each vehicle has data collected.
