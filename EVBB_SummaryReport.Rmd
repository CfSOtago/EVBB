# Note

Based on and inspired by the [UK DoT statistical report 2018](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/764270/electric-chargepoint-analysis-2017-domestics.pdf).

# Key Findings:

 * _Power supplied_: The median power supplied during domestic ('at home') standard charging event was XX kW. The mean was slightly lower/higher at XX kW. Fast charging events had a higher median of XX kW (mean = ) _Can't do without date column_
  * _Charging duration_: Charging durations tended to fall into one of two groups - longer 'overnight' charges with a median of XX hours and shorter events during the day both at standard and fast charge rates with a median duration of XX hours. _Can't do without date column_
  * _Time of Day_: charging events were more frequent at specific times of the day and day of the week with more evening and over-night charging during weekdays and more day-time charging at weekends. The power demand also varied according to time of day, day of the week and apparent location (home vs not home)
  
# Definitions:
The data consisted of X data points from N vehicles over M months (X - Y, 2018) derived from FlipTheFleet's [blackbox recorder](https://flipthefleet.org/ev-black-box/). The recorder provided measurements at 1 minute frequency of charging behaviour and battery charge state as well as geo-location via GPS.

The home location was defined as the location the vehicle was found most frequently between 00:00 and 06:00 (?). 'Not at home' was all other locations.

The capacity of most domestic charging is between 1.8kW to 7kW, whereas charging power above 7kW is available at purpose-built charging stations[@concept2018]. Each charging event was therefore seperated into "Fast" (above 7kW) and "Slow" (below 7kW). 

A charging event was defined as a continuous sequence of 1 minute observations per vehicle when > 0 kW was demand was observed. _Difficult to do accurately without date column due to charging occurring through the night_

For a discussion of data limitations see Section  \@ref(dataIssues).

# Daily demand

Fig: Mean and median kW demand per day by day of the week (Bar chart, faceted by slow vs fast). _Can't do without date column_

Fig: Power demand distributions (Histogram, faceted by at home vs not at home)

The median power demand was X kW (mean = ? kW) in 'home' charging events and 
Y kw (mean = ? kW) for 'not at home' events. _Can't do without date column_

X% of charging observations at home were X kW or less whilst those elsewhere tended to be higher. _expand to suit histogram_ _Can't do without GPS data_

Observations where power demand was greater than Y kW are likely to be ...
_Can't do without GPS data_

# Charging duration {#duration}

Fig: Histogram of charging event durations (faceted by at home vs not at home) _Can't do without date column_

The histogram shows two kinds of charging events - those of short duration and  much longer ones which tend to be overnight and occur at home. _Can't do without date column_

> Discuss any other patterns

> NB: are the durations being truncated at midnight as we do not have consecutive dateTimes?

# Time of charging

_Can do this with the data we have provided missing data implies zero charging_

Fig: profile of median charging demand by time of day and day of the week _Difficult to do without date column_ faceted by at home vs not at home _Would need GPS data_

Charging demand varies considerable by time of day, day of the week and imputed location. Weekdays show ... whilst weekends show. Saturdays and Sundays vary with... 

Fig: profile of start and end of charging events by time of day and day of the week _This we can do_ faceted by at home vs not at home _Would need GPS data_

At home charging events tended to begin at HH:MM during weekdays and HH:MM at weekends. 
_We can get "Slow" charging events rather than "home"_

Domestic charging has a noticeably different profile to charging patterns for chargepoints at other locations. It suggests that it is common for plug-in vehicle owners to charge overnight at home, and perhaps use the more powerful public chargepoints to top up during the day.

> Discuss any other patterns

# State of charge

The duration of charging events (see Section \@ref(duration)) suggests that EVs may be 'plugged in' at home (and elsewhere) for considerable durations. 

Fig: Distribution of state of charge when evening charge event starts 'at home' (histogram (or joy plot) by day of week)
![SOC when charging begins](~/EVBB/plots/SOC_when_charging_begins.png)

The figure shows that many vehicles arrive home with greater than 50% charge remaining and would therefore be able to transfer energy to the home during the evening grid peak as a form of demand response. 


Fig: Mean state of battery charge at the first 'at home' charging observation by hour and day of the week _No "at home" data with SOC_

> should show the timing of 'coming home' battery state?

Fig: Distribution of duration of charge events starting 'at home' in the evening (by day of the week) _Duration difficult to accurately determine without date due to charging occurring through the night_

The figure shows that vehicles may then be available for further demand reposne and/or re-charging for up to XX hours from this point.

# Data limitations {#dataIssues}
  
The GPS data used to determine location is not available for x% of observations possibly due to in-garage parking or other physical signal inhibition. Location cannot be deduced in these cases and has instead been imputed as the 'last' GPS location recorded. These errors may affect the location/'at home' coding.
