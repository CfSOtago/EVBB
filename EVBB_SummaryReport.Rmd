# Note

Based on and inspired by the [UK DoT statistical report 2018](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/764270/electric-chargepoint-analysis-2017-domestics.pdf).

Data used: `r dFile`

Observations: `r nrow(dt)`
Observed charging: `r nrow(chargingDT)` observations (power demand > 0)

# Definitions:
The data consisted of `r nrow(dt)` data points from `r length(levels(df$id))` vehicles over M months (X - Y, 2018) derived from FlipTheFleet's [blackbox recorder](https://flipthefleet.org/ev-black-box/). The recorder provided measurements at 1 minute frequency of charging behaviour and battery charge state as well as geo-location via GP.

The capacity of most domestic charging is between 1.8kW to 7kW, whereas charging power above 7kW is available at purpose-built charging stations[@concept2018]. Each charging event was therefore seperated into "Fast" (> = 7kW) and "Standard" (below 7kW). 

A charging event was defined as a continuous sequence of 1 minute observations per vehicle when > 0 kW was demand was observed. _Difficult to do accurately without date column due to charging occurring through the night when date hashes change. These hashes do not appear to have an order so we cannot distinguish the 2nd from the 3rd Thursday (for example) and so establish correct multi-day sequences._

For a discussion of data limitations see Section  \@ref(dataIssues).

# Key Findings:

```{r keyFindings}
stdMedian <- median(chargingDT[chargeType == "Standard charging"]$charge_power_kw, na.rm = TRUE)
stdMean <- mean(chargingDT[chargeType == "Standard charging"]$charge_power_kw, na.rm = TRUE)
  
fastMedian <- median(chargingDT[chargeType == "Fast charging"]$charge_power_kw, na.rm = TRUE)
fastMean <- mean(chargingDT[chargeType == "Fast charging"]$charge_power_kw, na.rm = TRUE)
```

 * _Power supplied_: The median power supplied during a standard charging was `r round(stdMedian,2)`  kW. The mean was slightly lower at `r round(stdMean,2)` kW. Fast charging observations had a higher median of `r round(fastMedian,2)` kW (mean = `r round(fastMean,2)`);
  * _Charging duration_: Charging durations tended to fall into one of two groups - longer 'overnight' charges with a median of XX hours and shorter events during the day both at standard and fast charge rates with a median duration of XX hours. _Gets truncated at midnight as not possible to determine exact sequence of days_
  * _Time of Day_: charging events were more frequent at specific times of the day and day of the week with more evening and over-night charging during weekdays and more day-time charging at weekends. The power demand also varied according to time of day and day of the week.

# Observed demand

Figure \@ref(fig:obsPower) shows the distribution of observed charging kW demand by inferred charge type. This plot shows that fast charges are relatively rare in the dataset whilst standard charges are much more common and, partly due to our definition, are concentrated around 3 kW. At the present time charging at home is likely to be predominatly standard charging whilst charging outside the home is likely to be a mix of the two.

```{r obsPower, fig.cap="Observed power demand distribution by day of the week and charge type where charging observed"}
p <- ggplot2::ggplot(chargingDT, aes(x = charge_power_kw, fill = chargeType, binwidth = 0.1)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_grid(. ~ chargeType, scales = "free")

# now draw the plot with any fancy extras we want
p + labs(y = "Density",
       x = "Power (kW)") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Charge type:")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=cbgPalette) + # use colour-blind friendly palette
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

The median power supplied during a standard charging was `r round(stdMedian,2)`  kW. The mean was slightly lower/higher at `r round(stdMean,2)` kW. Fast charging observations had a higher median of `r round(fastMedian,2)` kW (mean = `r round(fastMean,2)`).

```{r stdChargeSizing}
stdQT <- quantile(chargingDT[chargeType == "Standard charging"]$charge_power_kw)
fastQT <- quantile(chargingDT[chargeType == "Fast charging"]$charge_power_kw)
```

75% of standard charging observations were `r round(stdQT[[2]],2)` kW or more but the figure was `r round(fastQT[[2]],2)` kW or more for fast charging

# Daily demand

```{r dailyPower, fig.cap="Observed power demand distribution by day of the week and charge type"}
p <- ggplot2::ggplot(filter(dt, chargeType == "Standard charging" | chargeType == "Fast charging"), aes(x = day_of_week, colour = chargeType, group = day_of_week)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(y = charge_power_kw)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ chargeType)

# now draw the plot with any fancy extras we want
p + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + 
  labs(x = "Day of week",
       y = "Power (kW)") +
  guides(colour = guide_legend(title = "Charge type:")) +
  scale_colour_manual(values=cbgPalette) + # use colour-blind friendly palette
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:dailyPower) shows the distribution of observed charging kW demand by day of the week. We can see that fast charging varies in demand but standard charging is relatively constant across days.

> This is a bit of a kludge but...

If we assume that the first non-zero charge observation is the 'start' and the last non-zero charge observation within the vehicle id is the 'end' we can calculate the duration between the two. This assumes there is no missing data.



```{r calculateChargeDurations}
# select the observations which we've flagged as first & last in a sequence of charging
firstLastDT <- dt[chargeFlag == "first" | chargeFlag == "last"]

# flag the first of a pair
firstLastDT <- firstLastDT[, pairOK := ifelse(chargeFlag == "first" & shift(chargeFlag == "last", type = "lead"), "Pair start", NA)]
# flag the second of a pair
firstLastDT <- firstLastDT[, pairOK := ifelse(chargeFlag == "last" & shift(chargeFlag == "first"), "Pair end", pairOK)]

# calculate the time diff between all obs
firstLastDT <- firstLastDT[, pairDuration := difftime(time1 = dateTime, time2 = shift(dateTime), units = c("mins"))]

# we only want the time difference which was calculated for an obs where pairOK == "Pair end". This should also be where chargeFlag == "last" _except_ for where we have no 'first' (e.g. at start of data)

# note that we will still have pairs that bridge 00:00 which will give us -ve values
# if we have a -ve value then we need to change the calculation to add the time
# up to midnight from the start to the time after midnight to the end

firstLastDT <- firstLastDT[pairOK == "Pair start" & shift(pairDuration < 0, type = "lead"), 
                           toMidnight := difftime(time1 = as.hms("23:59:59"), time2 = time)]

firstLastDT <- firstLastDT[pairOK == "Pair end" & pairDuration < 0, 
                           afterMidnight := difftime(time1 = time, time2 = as.hms("00:00:00"), units = c("mins"))]

firstLastDT <- firstLastDT[, pairDurationFix := shift(toMidnight) + afterMidnight]

firstLastDT <- firstLastDT[, pairDurationFinal := ifelse(pairDuration <0,
                                                         pairDurationFix,
                                                         pairDuration)]

```

Figure \@ref(fig:durationHist) shows the overall distribution of all charging sequences. Clearly there are very small and a few very large values for Standard Charges but this is not the case for Fast charges.

```{r durationHist, fig.cap="Duration of charging sequences"}

ggplot2::ggplot(firstLastDT[pairOK == "Pair end"], 
                aes(x = pairDurationFinal)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) +
  facet_grid(chargeType ~ .) +
  labs(x = "Minutes")
```

Table \@ref(tab:durationDescTable) shows the overall distributions and indeicates the extent to which the means are skewed by the very small and a few very large values shown in Figure \@ref(fig:durationHist).

```{r durationDescTable}
t <- firstLastDT[pairOK == "Pair end", 
                 .(N = .N,
                   mean = mean(pairDurationFinal),
                   median = median(pairDurationFinal),
                   min = min(pairDurationFinal),
                   max = max(pairDurationFinal)), 
                 keyby = .(chargeType)]
kableExtra::kable(t, 
                  caption = "Duration of all charge sequences by charge type (minutes)", digits = 2) %>%
  kable_styling()
```

Figure \@ref(fig:shortDuration) shows the distribution of very short charging sequences which are likely to be 'top-ups' occuring towards the end of a longer charging period. As we can see these appear to be generally less than 8 minutes in length for Standard Charges.

```{r shortDuration, fig.cap="Duration of charging sequences < 10 minutes"}

ggplot2::ggplot(firstLastDT[pairOK == "Pair end" & pairDurationFinal < 10], 
                aes(x = pairDurationFinal)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  facet_grid(chargeType ~ .) +
  labs(x = "Minutes")
```

Table \@ref(tab:durationDescTableReduced) shows the same descriptive statistics but for all sequences of greater than 8 minute duration. Now we can see that the mean and median durations for Standard Charge sequences are closer at 130 - 140 minutes.

```{r durationDescTableReduced}
t <- firstLastDT[pairOK == "Pair end" & pairDurationFinal > 8, 
                 .(N = .N,
                   mean = mean(pairDurationFinal),
                   median = median(pairDurationFinal),
                   min = min(pairDurationFinal),
                   max = max(pairDurationFinal)), 
                 keyby = .(chargeType)]
kableExtra::kable(t, 
                  caption = "Duration of charge sequences > 8 minutes by charge type (minutes, )", digits = 2) %>%
  kable_styling()
```

Figure \@ref(fig:longDuration) shows the distribution of long (> 8 minutes) charging sequences. As we can see these appear to be generally less than 3 hours in length for Standard Charges.

Two incidences were calculated of charging events longer than 100 hours. As even a very high capacity vehicle using the slowest standard charger would not take this long to charge from empty, these were assumed to be anomalies and have been discarded from the following plots.

_NOTE these have not yet been discarded from the mean calculations_


```{r longDuration, fig.cap="Duration of charging sequences > 8 minutes"}

ggplot2::ggplot(firstLastDT[pairOK == "Pair end" & pairDurationFinal > 8 & pairDurationFinal < 6000], 
                aes(x = pairDurationFinal)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 20) +
  facet_grid(chargeType ~ .) +
  labs(x = "Minutes")
```

  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_grid(chargeType ~ .) +

       y = "Minutes")
```

                      .(meanDuration = mean(pairDurationFinal)),
                      keyby = .(qHour, chargeType)]

                aes(x = qHour, y = meanDuration, colour = chargeType)) +

  geom_density(alpha = 0.3) 
  facet_grid(~weekday)
p + labs(x = "Time", fill = "Charge type", title = "Density plot of charging end times during weekdays" )

```


```{r chargeEndsWeekend}
p <- ggplot(chargeEnds[chargeEnds$weekday == "Weekend", ], aes(x = qHour, fill = chargeType))  +
  scale_colour_manual(values=cbbPalette)+
  geom_density(alpha = 0.3) +
  facet_grid(~weekday)
p + labs(x = "Time", fill = "Charge type", title = "Density plot of charging end times during weekends" )

```



At home charging events tended to begin at HH:MM during weekdays and HH:MM at weekends. 
_We can get "Slow" charging events rather than "home"_

Domestic charging has a noticeably different profile to charging patterns for chargepoints at other locations. It suggests that it is common for plug-in vehicle owners to charge overnight at home, and perhaps use the more powerful public chargepoints to top up during the day.

# State of charge

The duration of charging events (see Section \@ref(duration)) suggests that EVs may be 'plugged in' at home (and elsewhere) for considerable durations. 


```{r value of state of charge at beginning of charge}
p <- ggplot(data=chargeBegins, aes(chargeBegins$SoC_percent)) + geom_histogram(bins = 10)
p + labs(x = "State of charge when charging begins (%)")
ggsave("~/EVBB/plots/SOC_when_charging_begins.png")
```

![SOC when charging begins](~/EVBB/plots/SOC_when_charging_begins.png)



The figure shows that many vehicles arrive home with greater than 50% charge remaining and would therefore be able to transfer energy to the home during the evening grid peak as a form of demand response.

Fig: Distribution of duration of charge events starting 'at home' in the evening (by day of the week) _Duration difficult to accurately determine without date due to charging occurring through the night_

The figure shows that vehicles may then be available for further demand response and/or re-charging for up to XX hours from this point.

# Data limitations {#dataIssues}
  
The GPS data used to determine location is not available for x% of observations possibly due to in-garage parking or other physical signal inhibition. Location cannot be deduced in these cases and has instead been imputed as the 'last' GPS location recorded. These errors may affect the location/'at home' coding.

```{r chargeFlagDiff}
chargeFlagDiff <- nrow(chargeEnds) - nrow(chargeBegins)
```


There are `r chargeFlagDiff` more instances of the charge ending than there are of the charge beginning. This may be due to the first instance of data collection occurring during mid-charge for some vehicles.
