# Version 2 of EVBB report

# Major changes:
# - uses drake to create & process data
# - introduces imputed 0 kW charing minute observations to 'fill out' data

# Packages needed ----
# use require so it fails if package missing
require(data.table)
require(drake)
require(hms) # for hh:mm:ss if we need it
require(lubridate) # for date & time manip

# library(ggjoy)
# library(dplyr) # for filter
# library(forcats) # used to reverse days of week in joy plots
