Data used: `r dFile`







Our results showed that... [when/where is the greatest amount of charging occurring? What is the power demand per vehicle/household/place of charging? What might this look like if 50% of households had an EV? What about if it matched current ICE ownership (eventually)?]


# Research questions

Need to find:
* The median average energy supplied by domestic charging events
Compare with UK findings og  was 7.5 kWh. If NZ findings are higher, it may be due to UK having more plug-in hybrids. 
* The mean average energy supplied 
Compare with UK findings of 9.1 kWh.
* Charging duration time each day of week
* Time of day that charging begins by day of week
* Plot time of day charging begins and time of day charging ends (weekend/weekday?)
* Plot average energy supplied by hour of start time (fast/slow charging)
* plot average duration of plug-in by hour of start time (fast/slow charging)
* Average energy use per vehicle per month
* Average number of charging events per vehicle per day for each day of week
* Average number of events per vehicle per w eek
* Median/mean amount of energy supplied per day of week (may not be easy to exactly determine)


# Methods
## Data


```{r load data}
df <- readr::read_csv(dFile)
```

This is a cross-references to Table \@ref(tab:tab1).

```{r tab1}

t <- summary(df)

knitr::kable(t, caption = "Data summary") # <- makes a pretty table
```


```{r create factors for the variables for which it will be useful}
df$day_of_week <- factor(df$day_of_week, ordered = TRUE,
                                     levels = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday","Thursday",
                                                "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")) 
df$month <- factor(df$month, ordered = TRUE, levels = c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May",
                                                        "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct",
                                                        "Nov", "Dec"))

weekdays1 <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
df$weekday <- factor((df$day_of_week %in% weekdays1), 
                   levels = c(TRUE, FALSE), labels = c('Weekday', 'Weekend'), ordered = TRUE) 

df$charging_rate <- cut(df$charge_power_kw, c(-Inf, 0.01, 7, Inf), labels = c('None', 'Slow', 'Fast'))


```

```{r half hours}
# code to half (or quarter) hours, removing seconds from formatting

df$halfHour <- format(as.POSIXct(hms::trunc_hms(df$time, 30*60)), "%H:%M")
df$quarterHour <- format(as.POSIXct(hms::trunc_hms(df$time, 15*60)), "%H:%M")

```

```{r rename car ids to something more user-friendly}
df$id <- factor(df$id, ordered = TRUE)
levSeq <- seq(1:length(levels(df$id)))
levSeqChar <- as.character(levSeq)

df$id <- factor(df$id,
  labels = levSeqChar)

df$id <- as.character(df$id)

df$id <- paste("Vehicle", df$id, sep = " ")


# It *might* be useful to do a similar thing with dayid, however it appears there is a seperate dayid per car per day (not same for different cars on same day)
# This would be unnecessary if I get a proper datetime stamp

```


```{r removal of silly percentage values}
df$state_of_charge_percent[df$state_of_charge_percent > 100] <- NA
df$state_of_charge_percent[df$state_of_charge_percent < 0] <- NA
```

The following dataframe "chargeBegins" is constructed out of all the instances where charging becomes non-zero after previously being zero, hopefully capturing the moment the car is initially plugged in. Data is also excluded where charging has stopped due to the car being fully charged and then starts again briefly, charging is turned off or on, etc.
Extra lag of 2 was provided due to some instances where there was only one minute where charging occurred, presumably due to regenerative braking.
This should be useful for establishing average state of charge when arriving home. 
Similarly, "chargeEnds" hopefully captures the time at which the vehicle becomes fully charged.
Note that the discrepency between the number of "charge begins" events and "charge ends" events indicated that there may be a better way of defining these.

```{r establishment of chargeBegins and chargeEnds dataframes}
chargeBegins <- filter(df, charge_power_kw > 0.1 & lag(charge_power_kw) < 0.1 &
                         lag(charge_power_kw, 2) < 0.1)
chargeBegins <- filter(chargeBegins, state_of_charge_percent < 97)

chargeEnds <- filter(df, charge_power_kw > 0.1 & lead(charge_power_kw) < 0.1 & lead(charge_power_kw, 2) < 0.1)
chargeEnds <- filter(chargeEnds, state_of_charge_percent < 97)

# Not sure why there are so many more instances of charge beginning than charge ending
```


```{r counting days in data}
dayCount <- table(df$day_of_week)
png(filename="~/EVBB/plots/day_count.png")
barplot(dayCount)
dev.off()

```

![Count of data by day](~/EVBB/plots/day_count.png) 
The above figure demonstrates that that for the current data set there is a disparity in the number of data points for each day, making analysis of averages etc difficult.

## Analysis

Analysis was conducted using R (`r R.version.string`) and the following packages:

 * ggplot2 [@ggplot2]
 * dplyr [@dplyr]

Reports were developed using knitr [@knitr] within bookdown [@bookdown].

# State of charge patterns

When analysing the potential for smart charging it is useful to understand daily patterns of the vehicle's "state of charge", in particular the percentage of energy left in the battery once the vehicle returns home. This is of particular significance when considering vehicle to grid (V2G) energy transfer. If there is a very high frequency whereby the driver only uses a particular percentage of the battery capacity in a day, there may be the ability to return electricity to the grid (or household) during grid congestion events or other occasions of very high electricity price, provided enough energy always remained in the battery for a typical day of travel.

Figure \@ref(plot:charging density plot by vehicle) shows a box plot of state of charge during the day. (Note that the zero values may be false - there seem to be no values that approach zero)
```{r charging density plot by vehicle}

p <- ggplot2::ggplot(df, aes(x = halfHour, group = halfHour, y = state_of_charge_percent)) +
  guides(colour = guide_legend(title = "Vehicle:")) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  scale_colour_manual(values=cbPalette) + # use colour-blind friendly palette
  geom_boxplot() # <- make the plot in an object first
p + labs(x = "Time of day", y = "State of charge (%)")
ggsave("~/EVBB/plots/SOC_throughout_day.png")
```
# Density plot of half-hour values (see when data is being collected)



```{r State of charge by weekend/weekday}

p <- ggplot2::ggplot(df, aes(x = halfHour, group = halfHour, y = state_of_charge_percent)) +
  guides(colour = guide_legend(title = "Vehicle:")) +
  scale_colour_manual(values=cbPalette) + # use colour-blind friendly palette
  geom_boxplot() +
  stat_summary(aes(group = weekday), fun.y=mean, geom="line", colour = "red")

p + labs(x = "Time of Day", y = "State of charge (%)") + facet_grid(~weekday) +  theme(legend.position = "bottom", axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) 
```

Need to get average SOC when charging begins. To do this, we will select all data whereby the charging rate is non-zero, but the previous charge rate is zero


## Research question 2

How might this affect the NZ electricity grid?
